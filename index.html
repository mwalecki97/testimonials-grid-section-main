      <h1 class="textheader1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>

        <p class="quot1">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      <p class="quot2">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
        for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

      <h1 class="textheader3">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
      <p class="quot3">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ”</p>

      <h1 class="textheader5">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
        learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>

      <p class="quot5">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
        junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
        an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
